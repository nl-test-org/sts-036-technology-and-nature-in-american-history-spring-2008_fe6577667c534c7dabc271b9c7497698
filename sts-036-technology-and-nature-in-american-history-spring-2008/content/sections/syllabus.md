Course Description
------------------

The central question of this course is how technological and natural forces have interacted in the making of modern America. Beginning in colonial America and ending in the twenty-first century, we will consider how the visual and material world of "nature" has been reshaped by industrial practices, ideologies, and institutions, with a particular emphasis on the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Through our lectures and readings we will visit a variety of landscapes—from small farms to suburbs, from Walden Pond to Yosemite National Park—in an effort to uncover not only the ways that technologies have shaped the landscapes around us, but also the ways that the natural world has resisted and redirected technological change. Topics include land-use patterns; the changing shape of cities and farms; the redesign of water systems; the construction of roads, dams, bridges, irrigation systems; the creation of national parks; ideas about wilderness; aesthetic responses to industrialization; and the role of nature in a "technological world."

General Course Requirements
---------------------------

Students are expected to attend all sessions and to be active participants in class discussion. More than two (2) unexcused absences will have an adverse effect on your grade. As this is a Communication-Intensive (CI) course, students will be assessed on both oral and written work: students will be required to lead class discussion at least once during the semester, to participate actively in each class discussion, to write frequent 1-2 page informal reading response papers, to write three (3) formal papers of increasing length, and to submit a draft and revision of the final research paper.

Required Reading and Writing
----------------------------

The following books are required for the course. Additional articles and book excerpts will also be assigned and distributed.

Basso, Keith. _Wisdom Sits in Places_. Albuquerque, NM: University of New Mexico Press, 1996. ISBN: 9780826317247.

Cronon, William. _Changes in the Land_. New York, NY: Hill & Wang, 2003. ISBN: 9780809016341.

Solnit, Rebecca. _River of Shadows: Eadweard Muybridge and Technological Wild West_. New York, NY: Penguin, 2004. ISBN: 9780142004104.

White, Richard. _The Organic Machine_. New York, NY: Hill & Wang, 1996. ISBN: 9780809015832.

Worster, Donald. _Dust Bowl_. New York, NY: Oxford University Press, 2004 \[1979\]. ISBN: 9780195174885.

Please note that the reading assignments should be completed before class on the day they are listed.

Students will be required to write 1-2 page reading response papers in preparation for weekly discussions. Response papers will be graded. Please email me your response papers no later than midnight the night before our discussion so that I can circulate them to the rest of the class. Response papers have two purposes: to help you generate ideas and questions about the week's topic, and to serve as a starting point for our discussion.

There are three (3) formal writing assignments in this class, as well as a revision of your final paper. I will distribute specific assignment descriptions for each paper as the course gets underway. Today is not too early to start thinking about your final paper, which can explore one of the course topics or a subject related to your other coursework or interests. I will help you design your topics and identify primary and secondary sources, and I will provide more specific research guidelines as you proceed.

Grading Policy
--------------

Students are expected to adhere to principles of academic honesty in their work. All written work must be a student's own original work. (Collaboration on essay assignments is not permitted.) Any and all references to other sources within your own paper must be properly documented according to the guidelines in the _Chicago Manual of Style_. If you have any questions about quoting, paraphrasing, or referring to the work of others, please ask! [MIT's Academic Integrity](http://web.mit.edu/academicintegrity/) handbook is a valuable resource that I urge you all to consult.

Grades will be calculated as follows:

| ACTIVITIES | PERCENTAGES |
| --- | --- |
| Paper 1 (5 pages) | 20% |
| Paper 2 (5-7 pages) | 25% |
| Paper 3 (10-12 pages) | 40% |
|  {{< br >}}{{< br >}} Class participation: {{< br >}}{{< br >}} *   Reading response papers - 5%{{< br >}}*   Leading of class discussion - 5%{{< br >}}*   General participation in weekly discussions - 5% {{< br >}}{{< br >}}  | 15% 

Please note that late papers will be penalized unless you have made prior arrangements with me for an extension.
